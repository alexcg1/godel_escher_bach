# Gödel Escher Bach

I read Gödel Escher Bach a couple of months ago, after several failed attempts over the years. Here are some potentially useful learning resources and tips.

## MIT Lectures

This [series of lectures from MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWZ2Bz0tS-s&list=PL2Im8p1voFZMsiVDP9f1D1F7hz6U8o1kE) helped immensely. They're potato-quality (they were last updated in 2013), but they help visualize and explain some (not all) aspects of the book's content (plus some cool other stuff that Hofstadter skims over or mentions in passing)

## Python snippets

The code samples in GEB are written in something like Algol60 (or Cuneiform, I forget which). I haphazardly wrote [equivalent code in Python](./python) for some of the samples. It's not pretty, it's badly organized, bits will be half-finished. Here be ~dragons~ stinking code. You have been warned. If anyone wants to clean it up, drop me a merge request!

## Forget e-books

I searched in vain for a decent ebook version. The best that is out there is scanned PDFs which haven't been OCRed. So GEB became the first physical book I bought in like a decade.

## Take a break

Don't try to take in too much at once. The book can be a slog at times. There's a reason so many people start and fail!

## Use the index

There's a lot to keep in your head, so it can be easy to lose track of what a Goldbach variation or whatever is. Use the index.

## Go beyond the book

I spent half my time doodling diagrams, working out math and writing code. I don't think this is a book you can read (and understand) without putting in that effort.

## Bask in your accomplishment!

How do you know someone ~is a vegan~ has read GEB? Don't worry, they'll let you know! If you get through it, don't hesitate to bring it up in every conceivable situation to assert your alpha geek status. Or until Hofstadter becomes a [milkshake duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck) (which I really hope doesn't happen) and then quietly deny you ever read the thing.
